                <h3><strong>Retirement</strong> Planning</h3>
                <p>Retirement is one of the biggest life changes you will face, so it is vital that you prepare for it properly.</p>
                <p>In the past few years new drawdown legislation, tax treatments and reductions in the lifetime and annual allowances have made pensions an increasingly complex area, and getting the right guidance is crucial.</p>
                <p>The further in advance you start planning for it, the more you improve your chances of achieving the retirement you want. However, even if your retirement is close and you’ve done little to prepare, any action you can take now is generally better than none.</p>
                <p>Our first question to you will be “Where are you now? followed by “Where do you want to be?”. We will provide lifestyle and cash flow modelling to identify shortfalls and we can then create a plan to solve them.</p>
                <p>Finura will then help you to create a robust and tax efficient retirement plan designed to provide security and flexibility in retirement.</p>

                <h3><strong>Pre-Retirement</strong></h3>
                <p>You are near enough to retirement to have some idea of your preferred lifestyle and your goals. This is the time to work out how you will afford them, so you can take any necessary action to boost your retirement income.</p>
                <p>At Finura, we can provide cash flow modelling which will assist in helping to determine how much you should save and how long it will take to achieve your desired retirement lifestyle. We will also advise on which investment options work best together and how to ensure your money is working as tax efficiently as possible.</p>

                <h3>At <strong>Retirement</strong></h3>
                <p>At this point you should be actively considering how you will take your income in retirement and from what source first. No matter how much (or how little) preparation you have done so far, the actions you take now can make a surprisingly big difference to your retirement income.</p>
                <p>Our team of advisers can help you to decide if you want to stop working fully or ease into retirement. We can then weigh up the options of how best to use your pension savings or other assets to be as tax efficient as possible.</p>

                <h3>In <strong>Retirement</strong></h3>
                <p>Although you are already in retirement, there are still plenty of options available to help you manage any changes in your plans and continue to make the most of the savings you have accumulated. It may be a change in investment strategy or risk profile or there may be a more tax efficient way to draw your income. Inheritance tax planning may now be a consideration.</p>
                <p>At all stages, our team can advise on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Asset allocation</li>
                    <li>Risk mapping and profiling</li>
                    <li>Pension, Lifetime and Annual allowance</li>
